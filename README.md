# Team-Profile-Generator
## Description
The Team Profile Generator is an application used to generate a web page of a user's team and team member details. The application
is run through the command line by prompting the user with a series of questions for them to answer about their team. The team consists
of 3 types of roles: Manager, Engineer and Intern. A user can select an employee's role through the command line 
when prompted by a list of role selections. Once a role has been chosen, more question prompts about the employee will follow
such as first name, last name, ID number, email, github, office number and school. Once all questions have been answered, a styled and ready webpage
will be generated for the user made to their specifications.
